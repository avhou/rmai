## Research question ideas

### Detecting single person vs persons in a crowd

First version of YOLO had difficulties with this task. The underlying reason was that each grid in the YOLO architecture is designed for single object detection.

### Does vantage point affects object detection

Broadly three categories could be used:

- Above horizon
- Near horizon
- Below horizon
